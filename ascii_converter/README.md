This project takes an image as input and converts it into an ascii art, using the symbols specified. The default image path is the sample_image.png, if not stated otherwise.

For a clearer view, copy the output generated into a notepad file and zoom out.

It uses opencv and numpy libraries which need to be installed externally using the pip command.
